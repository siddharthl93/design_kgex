Torque or force amplifying actuator and method for controlling actuator  - https://patents.google.com/patent/US5791228/

#################

The actuator is divided into two cells by a power transfer shaft to which is attached a vent follower 
The actuator (0) :: is (1) divided (2) into (3) :: two cells (4)
two cells (4) :: by (5) :: a power transfer shaft (6)
a vent follower (11) :: is (9) attached (10) to (7) :: a power transfer shaft (6)


In an equilibrium position, the vent is closed off by the vent follower 
the vent (3) :: is (4) closed (5) off (6) by (7) :: the vent follower (8)
the vent (3) :: In (0) :: an equilibrium position (1)


Moving the vent location to either side of the vent follower causes fluid or gas to escape from one or the other cell 
the vent location (1) :: to (2) :: either side (3)
either side (3) :: of (4) :: the vent (5)
the vent (5) :: :: follower (6)
follower (6) :: causes (7) :: fluid (8)

fluid (8) :: to (11) escape (12) from (13) :: the other cell (16)
gas (10) :: to (11) escape (12) from (13) :: the other cell (16)


In the rotary version, the vent follower operates in a wiper type fashion 
the vent follower (3) :: In (0) :: the rotary version (1)
the vent follower (3) :: operates (4) in (5) :: a wiper type fashion (6)


In the linear version, the power transfer shaft is attached to a piston head 
the power transfer shaft (3) :: In (0) :: the linear version (1)

At the equilibrium position, the vent and vent follower are in direct relation to one another 
the vent (3) :: At (0) :: the equilibrium position (1)
vent (5) :: :: follower (6)
follower (6) :: At (0) :: the equilibrium position (1)
the vent (3) :: in (8) :: direct relation (9)
